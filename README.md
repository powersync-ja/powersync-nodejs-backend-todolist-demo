# PowerSync Node.js Backend: Todo List Demo

## Overview

This repo contains a demo Node.js server application which has HTTP endpoints to authorize a [PowerSync](https://www.powersync.com/) enabled application to sync data between a client device and a PostgreSQL or MongoDB database.

The endpoints are as follows:

1. GET `/api/auth/token`

   - PowerSync uses this endpoint to retrieve a JWT access token which is used for authentication.

2. GET `/api/auth/keys`

   - PowerSync uses this endpoint to validate the JWT returned from the endpoint above.

3. PUT `/api/data`

   - PowerSync uses this endpoint to sync upsert events that occurred on the client application.

4. PATCH `/api/data`

   - PowerSync uses this endpoint to sync update events that occurred on the client application.

5. DELETE `/api/data`

   - PowerSync uses this endpoint to sync delete events that occurred on the client application.

## Packages

[node-postgres](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres) is used to interact with the Postgres database when a client performs requests to the `/api/data` endpoint.

[mongodb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb) iis used to interact with the Postgres database when a MongoDB + PowerSync enabled client performs requests to the `/api/data` endpoint.

[jose](https://github.com/panva/jose) is used to sign the JWT which PowerSync uses for authorization.

## Requirements

This app needs a Postgres instance that's hosted. For a free version for testing/demo purposes, visit [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).

## Running the app

1. Clone the repository
2. Follow the steps outlined in [PowerSync Custom Authentication Example](https://github.com/journeyapps/powersync-jwks-example) â†’ [Generate a key-pair](https://github.com/journeyapps/powersync-jwks-example#1-generate-a-key-pair) to get the keys you need for this app. This is an easy way to get started with this demo app. You can use your own public/private keys as well. Note: This backend will generate a temporary key pair for development purposes if the keys are not present in the `.env` file. This should not be used in production.
3. Create a new `.env` file in the root project directory and add the variables as defined in the `.env` file:

```shell
cp .env.template .env
```

4. Install dependancies

```shell
nvm use
```

```shell
yarn install
```

## Start App

1. Run the following to start the application

```shell
yarn start
```

This will start the app on `http://127.0.0.1:PORT`, where PORT is what you specify in your `.env` file.

2. Test if the app is working by opening `http://127.0.0.1:PORT/api/auth/token/` in the browser

3. You should get a JSON object as the response to that request

## Connecting the app with PowerSync

This process is only designed for demo/testing purposes, and is not intended for production use. You won't be using ngrok to host your application and database.

1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)
2. Run the ngrok command to create a HTTPS tunnel to your local application

```shell
ngrok http 8000
```

This should create the tunnel and a new HTTPS URL should be availible e.g.

```shell
ngrok by @inconshreveable                                                                                                                  (Ctrl+C to quit)

Session Status                online

Update                        update available (version 2.3.41, Ctrl-U to update)
Version                       2.3.40

Forwarding                    https://your_id.ngrok-free.app -> http://localhost:8000

Connections                   ttl     opn     rt1     rt5     p50     p90

```

3. Open the [PowerSync Dashboard](https://powersync.journeyapps.com/) and paste the `Forwarding` URL starting with HTTPS into the Credentials tab of your PowerSync instance e.g.

```
JWKS URI
https://your_id.ngrok-free.app/api/auth/keys/
```

Pay special attention to the URL, it should include the `/api/auth/keys/` path as this is used by the PowerSync server to validate tokens.
